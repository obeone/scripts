# Proxmox Tools 🖥️

Various helpers for Proxmox VE administration.

- **migration-watcher** – monitors QEMU live migrations with a text-based graph. See [migration-watcher/README.md](migration-watcher/README.md) for details.
- **restore-watcher** – monitors active restore tasks (qmrestore/pctrestore) with a tqdm-like progress dashboard. See [restore-watcher/README.md](restore-watcher/README.md) for details.

Each tool can be installed separately using `uv` or `pipx` from its directory.
